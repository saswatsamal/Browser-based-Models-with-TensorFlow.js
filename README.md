# Browser based Models with TensorFlow.js  
<hr>
One of the key skills for machine learning is not just making models but also deployment. One of the most exciting deployment scenarios is javascript, where you can train,      test, and make inferences right there in your web browser. It awesome, I mean awesome. Seeing your model getting deplyoed and testes at the same time in the browser is just awesome.

In this course I learned mostly about how we can reduce the size of the large datasets and deploy our model directly into our web-browsers. No need of heavy GPUs at user side because all the models, datasets are optimized for the web-browser.

List of the things that I've learned from this course:
  1. Simple Neural Network in Browser
  2. Image Classification In the Browser
  3. Visualization tool in Javascript
  4. Sprite Sheet
  5. Converting Models to JSON Format
  6. Transfer Learning in Javascript from Python

All these are the foundation of Tensorflow JS. But these are basics and we need to know about these terms and thoroughly and get acquainted with these things. Once you get completely acquainted then you can make more projects and interesting things using TFJs.
